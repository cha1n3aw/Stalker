Well, this is kinda weird stalking software for VK!
There are two branches: ImplicitFlowAuth (main) and RegularFlowAuth
I think the ImplicitFlow one is better because it doesnt depend on VK libs and uses OAuth to call for methods
RegularFlow one though is more "powerful" but is slower and depends on VkNet & VkNet.AudioBypass libs, so there could be bugs
Anyways ure welcome to test and contribute if u want ^_^
